FEATURES:
	1. Simulation of Collsions- Simulation of various types of stacked bodies when hit by an object.
		Following types of stacks are hard coded- Thin sheet, Large cuboid, Small cuboid, Pyramid, Hanging staircase(it falls uwhen played)
	2. Simulation of gravitational interaction among bodies.
		Following types of special (worth noticing interactions) are hard coded: Binary Star system, One Star Panetary system.
		In these special interactions we have hard coded special values of velocity such that centrifugal force balances the gravitational force resulting in stable orbits)
	3. Path Trace- A special feature that keeps history of trajectory of each body and shows it as a curve.
	4. Acceleration Vector- In case of planetary interactions, Acceleration vector is shown in red for each planet.
		(In case of circular motion in stable orbits, this vector is seen to be perpendicular to path trace.)
	5. The bodies can be transformed from simple(light) objects on earth to big heavy planets whith 'h' key.
	6. Pause and View - The whole simulation can be paused. Eye can still move anywhere and observe the trajectories. Path Trace stays static.
	While we choose any option from the RMB menu, the system is set and paused for the user to view. User can play the simulation and see the results.

CONTROLS:
	ESC-	Close the program
	p-		Toggle Path Trace( Removing it increases the speed of simulation)
	h- 		Toggle Heavenly Body(i.e. Gravitational Force of Attraction between the bodies)
	g-		Toggle Acceleration due to gravity (For normal objects placed in influence of gravity of earth)
	Space-	Toggle Pause and View(Pause the simultion and move around to see everything)
	Mouse,w,a,s,d-	Move the eye anywhere in 3D (As in any FPS Game)
	r,f-	Move eye vertically up/down.
	LMB-	Shoot a ball (from current position in the direction where eye is looking)
	RMB-	Explore lot of options that can be done including seeing star systems and collision simulation of large number of bodies.
	Num 8,9-	Increase Speed of Simulation
	Num 5,6-	Decrease Speed of Simulation
